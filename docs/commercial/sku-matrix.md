## What's in every tier

- Coltex EULA with full provenance documentation
- `manifest.json` with SHA-256 checksums
- `distribution_audit.json` compliance report
- Typed metadata on every document
- Quality gate validation (dedup, substance, license checks)
- Benchmark datasets for due diligence

## Enterprise Curated — recommended starting point

The **Enterprise Curated** tier combines the full knowledge-corpus architecture (63 domains, 18 hubs, graph links, domain routes, processing layers) with the standard product pipeline. This is the most polished, graph-rich deliverable.

```bash
make corpus-mega              # Expand to 10,000+ domain documents
make product-enterprise       # Chunk → embed → benchmark → manifest → audit
```

**Deliverables:** `data/product/` + `benchmarks/` + compliance files

---

## Premium Standard — validation & demos

25,000 procedurally streamed documents with audit samples on disk. Ideal for smoke-testing buyer pipelines before a hyper-scale run.

```bash
make product-premium-smoke
make audit-distribution
```

**Sample files:** `knowledge-base/distributable/_samples/` (1,000 audit markdown files)

---

## Premium Hyper — maximum scale

100-billion× procedural multiplier. Intended for cluster deployment (Vast.ai, cloud GPU). Uncapped document generation.

```bash
make product-hyper            # Requires cluster resources
```

Estimated procedural capacity: 600+ trillion unique document combinations.
