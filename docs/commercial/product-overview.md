# Coltex Enterprise RAG Vector Dataset

**Production-grade retrieval-augmented generation corpus for commercial deployment.**

Coltex is a fully auditable, graph-linked, vector-ready knowledge dataset designed for teams building enterprise RAG products, AI agents, and domain-specific copilots. Every document carries typed metadata, cross-reference edges, and compliance provenance.

## Why Coltex

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Scale** | 35,000+ deliverable documents (Enterprise tier); procedural capacity to billions+ |
| **Structure** | 63 technology domains · 18 knowledge hubs · 306 graph links · 90 domain routes |
| **Vector-ready** | Pre-chunked JSONL · optional pre-computed embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2) |
| **GraphRAG** | Typed relationship edges · hub clustering · region-aware GraphRouter |
| **Compliance** | Coltex EULA · full provenance · distribution audit pipeline |
| **Benchmarks** | FAQ pairs · retrieval gold · RAG evaluation datasets included |

## Architecture at a glance

```
Documents → Chunks → Embeddings → Vector index
     ↓
  Graph edges → GraphRAG expansion
     ↓
  Benchmarks → Quality evidence
```

Six processing layers (L1 ingestion through L6 governance), ten functional clusters, and four memory tiers organize content for retrieval routing and enterprise governance.

## Ideal use cases

- **Enterprise RAG copilots** — pre-built domain coverage across cloud, security, data, and platform engineering
- **Agent toolchains** — graph-linked runbooks, ADRs, and API references for multi-hop reasoning
- **Vector database seeding** — load `chunks.jsonl` + `embeddings.jsonl` into Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, or pgvector
- **Benchmark baselines** — reproducible recall@k and metadata accuracy evidence for buyer due diligence
- **Fine-tuning prep** — structured Q&A and retrieval gold pairs for domain adaptation
