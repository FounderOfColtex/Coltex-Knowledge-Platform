# LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning — Best Practices (v195)

## Principles

From first principles, **Principles** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (best_practices). This variant 195 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

From first principles, **Don't** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (best_practices). This variant 195 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface LoraSftConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleLoraSft(config: LoraSftConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
