# Context Window Budget Management — Benchmark (v215)

## Suite

When integrating with legacy systems, **Suite** for `Context Window Budget Management` (benchmark). This variant 215 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When integrating with legacy systems, **Methodology** for `Context Window Budget Management` (benchmark). This variant 215 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When integrating with legacy systems, **Dataset** for `Context Window Budget Management` (benchmark). This variant 215 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Context Window Budget Management benchmark variant 215.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.82 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3345 |
| error rate | 0.2160 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_215 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 215,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rag_215_topic ON rag_215 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM rag_215
WHERE topic = 'context_window' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
