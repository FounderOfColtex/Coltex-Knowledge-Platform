# RAG Evaluation Frameworks — Best Practices (v177)

## Principles

For production systems, **Principles** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (best_practices). This variant 177 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For production systems, **Do** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (best_practices). This variant 177 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For production systems, **Don't** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (best_practices). This variant 177 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Checklist

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_177 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 177,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rag_177_topic ON rag_177 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM rag_177
WHERE topic = 'rag_eval' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
