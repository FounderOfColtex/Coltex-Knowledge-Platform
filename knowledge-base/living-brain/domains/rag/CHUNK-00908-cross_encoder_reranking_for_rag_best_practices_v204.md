# Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG — Best Practices (v204)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG` (best_practices). This variant 204 covers cross_encoder, reranking, bi_encoder, fusion at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

Under high load, **Do** for `Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG` (best_practices). This variant 204 covers cross_encoder, reranking, bi_encoder, fusion at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

Under high load, **Don't** for `Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG` (best_practices). This variant 204 covers cross_encoder, reranking, bi_encoder, fusion at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class HybridReranking:
    """Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "hybrid_reranking", "variant": 204}
```
