# Authentication Service: JWT — Benchmark (v413)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `Authentication Service: JWT` (benchmark). This variant 413 covers auth_service, jwt, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `Authentication Service: JWT` (benchmark). This variant 413 covers auth_service, jwt, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `Authentication Service: JWT` (benchmark). This variant 413 covers auth_service, jwt, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Authentication Service: JWT benchmark variant 413.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.78 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 6315 |
| error rate | 0.4140 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
