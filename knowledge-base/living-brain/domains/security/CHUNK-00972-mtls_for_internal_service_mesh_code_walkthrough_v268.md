# mTLS for Internal Service Mesh — Code Walkthrough (v268)

## Problem

Under high load, **Problem** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (code_walkthrough). This variant 268 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_268 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 268,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_268_topic ON security_268 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_268
WHERE topic = 'mtls_internal' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
