# PII Detection in Code Repositories — Api Reference (v390)

## Endpoint

For security-sensitive deployments, **Endpoint** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (api_reference). This variant 390 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

For security-sensitive deployments, **Authentication** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (api_reference). This variant 390 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

For security-sensitive deployments, **Request Schema** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (api_reference). This variant 390 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

For security-sensitive deployments, **Response Schema** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (api_reference). This variant 390 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

For security-sensitive deployments, **Error Codes** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (api_reference). This variant 390 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PiiDetection:
    """PII Detection in Code Repositories"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "pii_detection", "variant": 390}
```
