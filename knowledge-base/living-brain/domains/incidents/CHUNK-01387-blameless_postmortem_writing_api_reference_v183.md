# Blameless Postmortem Writing — Api Reference (v183)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (api_reference). This variant 183 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (api_reference). This variant 183 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
