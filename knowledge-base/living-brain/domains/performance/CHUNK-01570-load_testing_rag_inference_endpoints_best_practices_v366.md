# Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints — Best Practices (v366)

## Principles

For security-sensitive deployments, **Principles** for `Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints` (best_practices). This variant 366 covers k6, locust, throughput, latency at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For security-sensitive deployments, **Do** for `Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints` (best_practices). This variant 366 covers k6, locust, throughput, latency at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For security-sensitive deployments, **Don't** for `Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints` (best_practices). This variant 366 covers k6, locust, throughput, latency at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
