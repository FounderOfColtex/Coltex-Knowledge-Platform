# Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints — Guide (v361)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints` (guide). This variant 361 covers k6, locust, throughput, latency at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface LoadTestingConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleLoadTesting(config: LoadTestingConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
