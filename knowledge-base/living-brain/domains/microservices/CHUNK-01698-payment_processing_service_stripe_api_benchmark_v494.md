# Payment Processing Service: Stripe API — Benchmark (v494)

## Suite

For security-sensitive deployments, **Suite** for `Payment Processing Service: Stripe API` (benchmark). This variant 494 covers payment_service, stripe api, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS microservices_494 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 494,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_microservices_494_topic ON microservices_494 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM microservices_494
WHERE topic = 'payment_service_stripe_api' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
