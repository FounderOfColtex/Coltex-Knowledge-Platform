# Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI — Best Practices (v330)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (best_practices). This variant 330 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agentic_330 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 330,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_agentic_330_topic ON agentic_330 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM agentic_330
WHERE topic = 'crewai_agents' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
