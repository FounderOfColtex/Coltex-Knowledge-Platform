# Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI — Guide (v325)

## Overview

During incident response, **Overview** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (guide). This variant 325 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface CrewaiAgentsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleCrewaiAgents(config: CrewaiAgentsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
