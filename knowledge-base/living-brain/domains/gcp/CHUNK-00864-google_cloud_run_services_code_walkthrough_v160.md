# Google Cloud Run Services — Code Walkthrough (v160)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (code_walkthrough). This variant 160 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gcp_160 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 160,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_gcp_160_topic ON gcp_160 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM gcp_160
WHERE topic = 'gcp_cloud_run' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
