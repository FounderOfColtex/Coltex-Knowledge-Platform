# PostgreSQL Index Strategies — Guide (v91)

## Overview

From first principles, **Overview** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (guide). This variant 91 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

From first principles, **Prerequisites** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (guide). This variant 91 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS postgresql_91 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 91,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_postgresql_91_topic ON postgresql_91 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM postgresql_91
WHERE topic = 'postgres_indexing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
