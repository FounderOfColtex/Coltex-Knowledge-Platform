# Graph Traversal for Dependency Analysis — Code Walkthrough (v7)

## Problem

When integrating with legacy systems, **Problem** for `Graph Traversal for Dependency Analysis` (code_walkthrough). This variant 7 covers bfs, dfs, pagerank, communities at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS graphrag_7 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 7,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_graphrag_7_topic ON graphrag_7 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM graphrag_7
WHERE topic = 'graph_traversal' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
