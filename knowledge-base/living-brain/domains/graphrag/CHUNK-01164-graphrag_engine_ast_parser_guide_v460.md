# GraphRAG Engine: AST Parser — Guide (v460)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `GraphRAG Engine: AST Parser` (guide). This variant 460 covers graphrag_engine, ast parser, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS graphrag_460 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 460,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_graphrag_460_topic ON graphrag_460 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM graphrag_460
WHERE topic = 'graphrag_engine_ast_parser' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
