# Weaviate Schema Design — Api Reference (v309)

## Endpoint

During incident response, **Endpoint** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (api_reference). This variant 309 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

During incident response, **Authentication** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (api_reference). This variant 309 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

During incident response, **Request Schema** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (api_reference). This variant 309 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

During incident response, **Response Schema** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (api_reference). This variant 309 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

During incident response, **Error Codes** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (api_reference). This variant 309 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface WeaviateSchemaConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleWeaviateSchema(config: WeaviateSchemaConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
