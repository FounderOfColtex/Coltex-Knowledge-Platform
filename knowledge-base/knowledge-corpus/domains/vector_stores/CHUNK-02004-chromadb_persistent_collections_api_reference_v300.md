# ChromaDB Persistent Collections — Api Reference (v300)

## Endpoint

Under high load, **Endpoint** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (api_reference). This variant 300 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

Under high load, **Authentication** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (api_reference). This variant 300 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

Under high load, **Request Schema** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (api_reference). This variant 300 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

Under high load, **Response Schema** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (api_reference). This variant 300 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

Under high load, **Error Codes** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (api_reference). This variant 300 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.
