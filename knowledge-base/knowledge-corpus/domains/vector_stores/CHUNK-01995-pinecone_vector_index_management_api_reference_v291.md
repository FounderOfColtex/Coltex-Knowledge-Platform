# Pinecone Vector Index Management — Api Reference (v291)

## Endpoint

From first principles, **Endpoint** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (api_reference). This variant 291 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

From first principles, **Authentication** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (api_reference). This variant 291 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

From first principles, **Request Schema** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (api_reference). This variant 291 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

From first principles, **Response Schema** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (api_reference). This variant 291 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes
