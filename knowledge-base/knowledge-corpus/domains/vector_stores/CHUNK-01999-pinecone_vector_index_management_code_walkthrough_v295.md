# Pinecone Vector Index Management — Code Walkthrough (v295)

## Problem

When integrating with legacy systems, **Problem** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (code_walkthrough). This variant 295 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PineconeIndexing:
    """Pinecone Vector Index Management"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "pinecone_indexing", "variant": 295}
```
