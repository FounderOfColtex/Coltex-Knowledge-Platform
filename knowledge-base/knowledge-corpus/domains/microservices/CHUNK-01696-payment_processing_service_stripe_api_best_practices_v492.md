# Payment Processing Service: Stripe API — Best Practices (v492)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Payment Processing Service: Stripe API` (best_practices). This variant 492 covers payment_service, stripe api, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
