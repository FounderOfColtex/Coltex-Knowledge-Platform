# Microservices Saga Pattern — Code Walkthrough (v169)

## Problem

For production systems, **Problem** for `Microservices Saga Pattern` (code_walkthrough). This variant 169 covers saga, compensation, orchestration, choreography at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface MicroservicesSagaConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleMicroservicesSaga(config: MicroservicesSagaConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
