# Payment Processing Service: Stripe API — Guide (v487)

## Overview

When integrating with legacy systems, **Overview** for `Payment Processing Service: Stripe API` (guide). This variant 487 covers payment_service, stripe api, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface PaymentServiceStripeApiConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handlePaymentServiceStripeApi(config: PaymentServiceStripeApiConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
