# Payment Processing Service: Stripe API — Best Practices (v492)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Payment Processing Service: Stripe API` (best_practices). This variant 492 covers payment_service, stripe api, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS microservices_492 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 492,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_microservices_492_topic ON microservices_492 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM microservices_492
WHERE topic = 'payment_service_stripe_api' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
