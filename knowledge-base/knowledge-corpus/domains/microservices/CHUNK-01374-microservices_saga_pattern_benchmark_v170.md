# Microservices Saga Pattern — Benchmark (v170)

## Suite

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Suite** for `Microservices Saga Pattern` (benchmark). This variant 170 covers saga, compensation, orchestration, choreography at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Methodology** for `Microservices Saga Pattern` (benchmark). This variant 170 covers saga, compensation, orchestration, choreography at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Dataset** for `Microservices Saga Pattern` (benchmark). This variant 170 covers saga, compensation, orchestration, choreography at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Microservices Saga Pattern benchmark variant 170.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.72 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2670 |
| error rate | 0.1710 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

```typescript
interface MicroservicesSagaConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleMicroservicesSaga(config: MicroservicesSagaConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
