# API Contract Testing with Pact — Guide (v397)

## Overview

During incident response, **Overview** for `API Contract Testing with Pact` (guide). This variant 397 covers pact, contracts, consumer, provider at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS testing_397 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 397,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_testing_397_topic ON testing_397 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM testing_397
WHERE topic = 'contract_testing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
