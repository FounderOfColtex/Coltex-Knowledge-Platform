# MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines — Guide (v100)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines` (guide). This variant 100 covers aggregation, sharding, indexes, schema_design at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```javascript
export async function handleMongodbAggregation(config) {
  const { topic = "mongodb_aggregation", variant = 100 } = config;
  return { status: "ok", topic, variant };
}
```
