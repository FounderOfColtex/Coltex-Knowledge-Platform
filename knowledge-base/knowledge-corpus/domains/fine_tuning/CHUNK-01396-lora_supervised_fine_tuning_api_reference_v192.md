# LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning — Api Reference (v192)

## Endpoint

In practice, **Endpoint** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (api_reference). This variant 192 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

In practice, **Authentication** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (api_reference). This variant 192 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
