# Azure Functions Architecture — Benchmark (v152)

## Suite

In practice, **Suite** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (benchmark). This variant 152 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

In practice, **Methodology** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (benchmark). This variant 152 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

In practice, **Dataset** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (benchmark). This variant 152 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Azure Functions Architecture benchmark variant 152.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.76 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2400 |
| error rate | 0.1530 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AzureFunctions:
    """Azure Functions Architecture"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "azure_functions", "variant": 152}
```
