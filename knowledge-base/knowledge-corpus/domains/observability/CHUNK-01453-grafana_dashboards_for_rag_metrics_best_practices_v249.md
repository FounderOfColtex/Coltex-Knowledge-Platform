# Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics — Best Practices (v249)

## Principles

For production systems, **Principles** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (best_practices). This variant 249 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface GrafanaDashboardsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGrafanaDashboards(config: GrafanaDashboardsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
