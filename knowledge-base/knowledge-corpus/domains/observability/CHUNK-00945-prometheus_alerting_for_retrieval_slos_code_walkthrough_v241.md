# Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs — Code Walkthrough (v241)

## Problem

For production systems, **Problem** for `Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs` (code_walkthrough). This variant 241 covers prometheus, alertmanager, slo, burn_rate at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PrometheusAlerts:
    """Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "prometheus_alerts", "variant": 241}
```
