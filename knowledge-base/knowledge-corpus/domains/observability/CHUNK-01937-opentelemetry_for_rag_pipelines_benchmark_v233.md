# OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines — Benchmark (v233)

## Suite

For production systems, **Suite** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 233 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For production systems, **Methodology** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 233 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For production systems, **Dataset** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 233 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines benchmark variant 233.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.78 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3615 |
| error rate | 0.2340 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface OtelObservabilityConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleOtelObservability(config: OtelObservabilityConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
