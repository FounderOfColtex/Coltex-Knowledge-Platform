# Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs — Benchmark (v242)

## Suite

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Suite** for `Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs` (benchmark). This variant 242 covers prometheus, alertmanager, slo, burn_rate at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

## Metrics

**Metrics** — Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs benchmark variant 242.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.76 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3750 |
| error rate | 0.2430 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS observability_242 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 242,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_observability_242_topic ON observability_242 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM observability_242
WHERE topic = 'prometheus_alerts' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
