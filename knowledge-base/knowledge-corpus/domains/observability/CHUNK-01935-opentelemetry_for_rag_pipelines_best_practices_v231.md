# OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines — Best Practices (v231)

## Principles

When integrating with legacy systems, **Principles** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 231 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When integrating with legacy systems, **Do** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 231 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When integrating with legacy systems, **Don't** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 231 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
