# OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines — Code Walkthrough (v232)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (code_walkthrough). This variant 232 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
