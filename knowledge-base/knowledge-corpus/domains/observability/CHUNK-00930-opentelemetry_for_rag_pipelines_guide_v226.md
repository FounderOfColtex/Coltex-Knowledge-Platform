# OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines — Guide (v226)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines` (guide). This variant 226 covers opentelemetry, traces, metrics, spans at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class OtelObservability:
    """OpenTelemetry for RAG Pipelines"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "otel_observability", "variant": 226}
```
