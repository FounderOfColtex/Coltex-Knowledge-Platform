# Rust Ownership in Systems Programming — Api Reference (v75)

## Endpoint

From first principles, **Endpoint** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (api_reference). This variant 75 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

From first principles, **Authentication** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (api_reference). This variant 75 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

From first principles, **Request Schema** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (api_reference). This variant 75 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

From first principles, **Response Schema** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (api_reference). This variant 75 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

From first principles, **Error Codes** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (api_reference). This variant 75 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```rust
pub struct RustOwnership {
    pub topic: String,
    pub variant: u32,
}

impl RustOwnership {
    pub fn process(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        serde_json::json!({"status": "ok", "topic": self.topic, "variant": self.variant})
    }
}
```
