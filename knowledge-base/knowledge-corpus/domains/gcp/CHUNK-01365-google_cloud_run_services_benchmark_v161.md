# Google Cloud Run Services — Benchmark (v161)

## Suite

For production systems, **Suite** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (benchmark). This variant 161 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For production systems, **Methodology** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (benchmark). This variant 161 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For production systems, **Dataset** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (benchmark). This variant 161 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Google Cloud Run Services benchmark variant 161.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.74 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2535 |
| error rate | 0.1620 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface GcpCloudRunConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGcpCloudRun(config: GcpCloudRunConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
