# Google Cloud Run Services — Guide (v154)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (guide). This variant 154 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Prerequisites** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (guide). This variant 154 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Core Concepts

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gcp_154 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 154,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_gcp_154_topic ON gcp_154 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM gcp_154
WHERE topic = 'gcp_cloud_run' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
