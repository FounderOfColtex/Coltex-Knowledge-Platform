# RAG Evaluation Frameworks — Api Reference (v174)

## Endpoint

For security-sensitive deployments, **Endpoint** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (api_reference). This variant 174 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

For security-sensitive deployments, **Authentication** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (api_reference). This variant 174 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

For security-sensitive deployments, **Request Schema** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (api_reference). This variant 174 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

For security-sensitive deployments, **Response Schema** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (api_reference). This variant 174 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.
