# Context Window Budget Management — Api Reference (v210)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Context Window Budget Management` (api_reference). This variant 210 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
