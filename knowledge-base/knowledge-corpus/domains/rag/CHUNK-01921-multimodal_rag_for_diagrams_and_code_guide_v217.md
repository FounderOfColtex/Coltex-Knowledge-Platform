# Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code — Guide (v217)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (guide). This variant 217 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_217 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 217,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rag_217_topic ON rag_217 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM rag_217
WHERE topic = 'multimodal_rag' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
