# Context Window Budget Management — Guide (v208)

## Overview

In practice, **Overview** for `Context Window Budget Management` (guide). This variant 208 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_208 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 208,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rag_208_topic ON rag_208 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM rag_208
WHERE topic = 'context_window' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
