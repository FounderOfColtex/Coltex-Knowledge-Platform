# RAG Evaluation Frameworks — Benchmark (v179)

## Suite

From first principles, **Suite** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (benchmark). This variant 179 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

From first principles, **Methodology** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (benchmark). This variant 179 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

From first principles, **Dataset** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (benchmark). This variant 179 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — RAG Evaluation Frameworks benchmark variant 179.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.90 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2805 |
| error rate | 0.1800 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
