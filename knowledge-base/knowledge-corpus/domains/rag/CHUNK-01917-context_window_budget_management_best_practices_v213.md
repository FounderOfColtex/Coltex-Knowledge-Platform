# Context Window Budget Management — Best Practices (v213)

## Principles

During incident response, **Principles** for `Context Window Budget Management` (best_practices). This variant 213 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

During incident response, **Do** for `Context Window Budget Management` (best_practices). This variant 213 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

During incident response, **Don't** for `Context Window Budget Management` (best_practices). This variant 213 covers token_budget, truncation, priority, compression at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
