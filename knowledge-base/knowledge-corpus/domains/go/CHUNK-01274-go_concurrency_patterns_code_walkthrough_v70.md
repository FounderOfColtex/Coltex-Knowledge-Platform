# Go Concurrency Patterns — Code Walkthrough (v70)

## Problem

For security-sensitive deployments, **Problem** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (code_walkthrough). This variant 70 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Tests

For security-sensitive deployments, **Tests** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (code_walkthrough). This variant 70 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level.

## Reference Implementation

```go
package main

type GoConcurrency struct {
    Topic   string
    Variant int
}

func (s *GoConcurrency) Process() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{"status": "ok", "topic": "go_concurrency", "variant": 70}
}
```
