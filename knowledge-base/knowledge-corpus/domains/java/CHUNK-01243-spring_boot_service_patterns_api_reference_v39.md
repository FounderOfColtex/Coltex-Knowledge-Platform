# Spring Boot Service Patterns — Api Reference (v39)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 39 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 39 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Request Schema** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 39 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Response Schema** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 39 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

When integrating with legacy systems, **Error Codes** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 39 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```java
public class JavaSpring {
    private final String topic = "java_spring";
    private final int variant = 39;

    public Record<String, Object> process(Map<String, Object> payload) {
        return Map.of("status", "ok", "topic", topic, "variant", variant);
    }
}
```
