# Docker Compose for Local Dev — Guide (v118)

## Overview

For security-sensitive deployments, **Overview** for `Docker Compose for Local Dev` (guide). This variant 118 covers compose, volumes, networks, healthchecks at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
