# Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines — Api Reference (v372)

## Endpoint

Under high load, **Endpoint** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (api_reference). This variant 372 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

Under high load, **Authentication** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (api_reference). This variant 372 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

Under high load, **Request Schema** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (api_reference). This variant 372 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

Under high load, **Response Schema** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (api_reference). This variant 372 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class CostOptimization:
    """Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "cost_optimization", "variant": 372}
```
