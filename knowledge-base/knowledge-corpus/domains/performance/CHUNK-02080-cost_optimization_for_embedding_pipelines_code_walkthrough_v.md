# Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines — Code Walkthrough (v376)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (code_walkthrough). This variant 376 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS performance_376 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 376,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_performance_376_topic ON performance_376 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM performance_376
WHERE topic = 'cost_optimization' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
