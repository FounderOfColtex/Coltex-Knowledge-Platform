# Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems — Code Walkthrough (v16)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (code_walkthrough). This variant 16 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
