# Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI — Api Reference (v327)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (api_reference). This variant 327 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (api_reference). This variant 327 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Request Schema** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (api_reference). This variant 327 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When integrating with legacy systems, **Response Schema** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (api_reference). This variant 327 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agentic_327 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 327,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_agentic_327_topic ON agentic_327 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM agentic_327
WHERE topic = 'crewai_agents' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
