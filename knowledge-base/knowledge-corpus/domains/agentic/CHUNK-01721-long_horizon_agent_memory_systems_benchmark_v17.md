# Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems — Benchmark (v17)

## Suite

For production systems, **Suite** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (benchmark). This variant 17 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For production systems, **Methodology** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (benchmark). This variant 17 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For production systems, **Dataset** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (benchmark). This variant 17 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems benchmark variant 17.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.86 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 375 |
| error rate | 0.0180 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
