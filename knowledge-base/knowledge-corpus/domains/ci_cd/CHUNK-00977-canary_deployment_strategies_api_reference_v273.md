# Canary Deployment Strategies — Api Reference (v273)

## Endpoint

For production systems, **Endpoint** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 273 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

For production systems, **Authentication** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 273 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

For production systems, **Request Schema** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 273 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

For production systems, **Response Schema** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 273 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

For production systems, **Error Codes** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (api_reference). This variant 273 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface CanaryDeployConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleCanaryDeploy(config: CanaryDeployConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
