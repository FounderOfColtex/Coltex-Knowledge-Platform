# Feature Flag Rollout Patterns — Best Practices (v285)

## Principles

During incident response, **Principles** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

During incident response, **Do** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

During incident response, **Don't** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface FeatureFlagsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleFeatureFlags(config: FeatureFlagsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
