# Feature Flag Rollout Patterns — Best Practices (v285)

## Principles

During incident response, **Principles** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

During incident response, **Do** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

During incident response, **Don't** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 285 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Checklist

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ci_cd_285 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 285,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ci_cd_285_topic ON ci_cd_285 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM ci_cd_285
WHERE topic = 'feature_flags' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
