# Feature Flag Rollout Patterns — Api Reference (v282)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 282 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Authentication** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 282 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Request Schema** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 282 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Response Schema** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 282 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout.

## Error Codes

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Error Codes** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 282 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class FeatureFlags:
    """Feature Flag Rollout Patterns"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "feature_flags", "variant": 282}
```
