# AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns — Guide (v136)

## Overview

In practice, **Overview** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (guide). This variant 136 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

In practice, **Prerequisites** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (guide). This variant 136 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS aws_136 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 136,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_aws_136_topic ON aws_136 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM aws_136
WHERE topic = 'aws_lambda' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
