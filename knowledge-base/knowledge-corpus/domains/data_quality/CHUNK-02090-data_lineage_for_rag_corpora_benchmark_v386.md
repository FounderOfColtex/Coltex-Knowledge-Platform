# Data Lineage for RAG Corpora — Benchmark (v386)

## Suite

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Suite** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (benchmark). This variant 386 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Methodology** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (benchmark). This variant 386 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Dataset** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (benchmark). This variant 386 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Data Lineage for RAG Corpora benchmark variant 386.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.84 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 5910 |
| error rate | 0.3870 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data_quality_386 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 386,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_data_quality_386_topic ON data_quality_386 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM data_quality_386
WHERE topic = 'data_lineage' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
