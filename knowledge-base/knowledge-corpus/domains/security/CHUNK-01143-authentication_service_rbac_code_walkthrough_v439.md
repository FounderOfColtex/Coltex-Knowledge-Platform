# Authentication Service: RBAC — Code Walkthrough (v439)

## Problem

When integrating with legacy systems, **Problem** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (code_walkthrough). This variant 439 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_439 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 439,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_439_topic ON security_439 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_439
WHERE topic = 'auth_service_rbac' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
