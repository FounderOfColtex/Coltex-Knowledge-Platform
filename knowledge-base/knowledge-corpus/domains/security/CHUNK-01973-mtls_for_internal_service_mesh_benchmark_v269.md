# mTLS for Internal Service Mesh — Benchmark (v269)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (benchmark). This variant 269 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (benchmark). This variant 269 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (benchmark). This variant 269 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — mTLS for Internal Service Mesh benchmark variant 269.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.90 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 4155 |
| error rate | 0.2700 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_269 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 269,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_269_topic ON security_269 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_269
WHERE topic = 'mtls_internal' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
