# Authentication Service: Session Management — Best Practices (v447)

## Principles

When integrating with legacy systems, **Principles** for `Authentication Service: Session Management` (best_practices). This variant 447 covers auth_service, session management, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AuthServiceSessionManagementConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAuthServiceSessionManagement(config: AuthServiceSessionManagementConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
