# HashiCorp Vault for API Keys — Api Reference (v255)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `HashiCorp Vault for API Keys` (api_reference). This variant 255 covers vault, secrets, rotation, policies at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `HashiCorp Vault for API Keys` (api_reference). This variant 255 covers vault, secrets, rotation, policies at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_255 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 255,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_255_topic ON security_255 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_255
WHERE topic = 'vault_secrets' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
