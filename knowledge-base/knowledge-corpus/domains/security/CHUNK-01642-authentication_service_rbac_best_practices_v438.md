# Authentication Service: RBAC — Best Practices (v438)

## Principles

For security-sensitive deployments, **Principles** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For security-sensitive deployments, **Do** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For security-sensitive deployments, **Don't** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AuthServiceRbacConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAuthServiceRbac(config: AuthServiceRbacConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
