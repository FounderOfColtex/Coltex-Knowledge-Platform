# Authentication Service: OAuth — Benchmark (v431)

## Suite

When integrating with legacy systems, **Suite** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (benchmark). This variant 431 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When integrating with legacy systems, **Methodology** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (benchmark). This variant 431 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When integrating with legacy systems, **Dataset** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (benchmark). This variant 431 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Authentication Service: OAuth benchmark variant 431.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.74 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 6585 |
| error rate | 0.4320 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AuthServiceOauth:
    """Authentication Service: OAuth"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "auth_service_oauth", "variant": 431}
```
