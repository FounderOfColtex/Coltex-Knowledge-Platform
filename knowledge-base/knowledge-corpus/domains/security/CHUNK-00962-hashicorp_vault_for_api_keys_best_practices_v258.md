# HashiCorp Vault for API Keys — Best Practices (v258)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `HashiCorp Vault for API Keys` (best_practices). This variant 258 covers vault, secrets, rotation, policies at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_258 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 258,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_258_topic ON security_258 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_258
WHERE topic = 'vault_secrets' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
