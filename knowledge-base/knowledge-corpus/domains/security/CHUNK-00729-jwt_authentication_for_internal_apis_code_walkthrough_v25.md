# JWT Authentication for Internal APIs — Code Walkthrough (v25)

## Problem

For production systems, **Problem** for `JWT Authentication for Internal APIs` (code_walkthrough). This variant 25 covers jwt, oauth, rbac, tokens at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
