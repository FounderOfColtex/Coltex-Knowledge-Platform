# Authentication Service: Session Management — Guide (v442)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `Authentication Service: Session Management` (guide). This variant 442 covers auth_service, session management, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
