# mTLS for Internal Service Mesh — Best Practices (v267)

## Principles

From first principles, **Principles** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (best_practices). This variant 267 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

From first principles, **Do** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (best_practices). This variant 267 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

From first principles, **Don't** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (best_practices). This variant 267 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class MtlsInternal:
    """mTLS for Internal Service Mesh"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "mtls_internal", "variant": 267}
```
