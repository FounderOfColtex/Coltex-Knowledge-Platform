# Authentication Service: RBAC — Guide (v433)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (guide). This variant 433 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AuthServiceRbac:
    """Authentication Service: RBAC"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "auth_service_rbac", "variant": 433}
```
