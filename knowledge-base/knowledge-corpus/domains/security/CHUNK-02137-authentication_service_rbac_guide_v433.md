# Authentication Service: RBAC — Guide (v433)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (guide). This variant 433 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
