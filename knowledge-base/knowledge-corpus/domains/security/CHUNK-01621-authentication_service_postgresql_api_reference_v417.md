# Authentication Service: PostgreSQL — Api Reference (v417)

## Endpoint

For production systems, **Endpoint** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 417 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

For production systems, **Authentication** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 417 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

For production systems, **Request Schema** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 417 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

For production systems, **Response Schema** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 417 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

For production systems, **Error Codes** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 417 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AuthServicePostgresql:
    """Authentication Service: PostgreSQL"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "auth_service_postgresql", "variant": 417}
```
