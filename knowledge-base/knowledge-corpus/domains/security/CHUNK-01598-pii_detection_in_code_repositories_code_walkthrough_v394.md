# PII Detection in Code Repositories — Code Walkthrough (v394)

## Problem

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Problem** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (code_walkthrough). This variant 394 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_394 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 394,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_394_topic ON security_394 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_394
WHERE topic = 'pii_detection' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
