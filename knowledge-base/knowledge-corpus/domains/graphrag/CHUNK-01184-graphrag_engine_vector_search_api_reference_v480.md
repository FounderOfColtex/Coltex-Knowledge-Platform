# GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search — Api Reference (v480)

## Endpoint

In practice, **Endpoint** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (api_reference). This variant 480 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

In practice, **Authentication** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (api_reference). This variant 480 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineVectorSearchConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineVectorSearch(config: GraphragEngineVectorSearchConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
