# GraphRAG Engine: Traversal — Guide (v469)

## Overview

During incident response, **Overview** for `GraphRAG Engine: Traversal` (guide). This variant 469 covers graphrag_engine, traversal, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineTraversalConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineTraversal(config: GraphragEngineTraversalConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
