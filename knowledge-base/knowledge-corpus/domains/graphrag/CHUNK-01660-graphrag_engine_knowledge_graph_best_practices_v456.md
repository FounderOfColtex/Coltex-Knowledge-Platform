# GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph — Best Practices (v456)

## Principles

In practice, **Principles** for `GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph` (best_practices). This variant 456 covers graphrag_engine, knowledge graph, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineKnowledgeGraphConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineKnowledgeGraph(config: GraphragEngineKnowledgeGraphConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
