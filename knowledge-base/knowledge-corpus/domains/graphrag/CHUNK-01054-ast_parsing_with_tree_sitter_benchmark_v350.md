# AST Parsing with Tree-sitter — Benchmark (v350)

## Suite

For security-sensitive deployments, **Suite** for `AST Parsing with Tree-sitter` (benchmark). This variant 350 covers tree_sitter, ast, parsing, symbols at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For security-sensitive deployments, **Methodology** for `AST Parsing with Tree-sitter` (benchmark). This variant 350 covers tree_sitter, ast, parsing, symbols at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For security-sensitive deployments, **Dataset** for `AST Parsing with Tree-sitter` (benchmark). This variant 350 covers tree_sitter, ast, parsing, symbols at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — AST Parsing with Tree-sitter benchmark variant 350.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.72 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 5370 |
| error rate | 0.3510 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS graphrag_350 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 350,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_graphrag_350_topic ON graphrag_350 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM graphrag_350
WHERE topic = 'ast_parsing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
