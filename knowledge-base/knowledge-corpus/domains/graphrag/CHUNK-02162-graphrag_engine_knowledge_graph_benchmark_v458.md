# GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph — Benchmark (v458)

## Suite

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Suite** for `GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph` (benchmark). This variant 458 covers graphrag_engine, knowledge graph, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

## Dataset

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Dataset** for `GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph` (benchmark). This variant 458 covers graphrag_engine, knowledge graph, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph benchmark variant 458.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.88 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 6990 |
