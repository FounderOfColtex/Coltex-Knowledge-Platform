# AST Parsing with Tree-sitter — Guide (v343)

## Overview

When integrating with legacy systems, **Overview** for `AST Parsing with Tree-sitter` (guide). This variant 343 covers tree_sitter, ast, parsing, symbols at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS graphrag_343 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 343,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_graphrag_343_topic ON graphrag_343 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM graphrag_343
WHERE topic = 'ast_parsing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
