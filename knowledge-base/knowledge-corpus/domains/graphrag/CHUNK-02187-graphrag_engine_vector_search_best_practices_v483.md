# GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search — Best Practices (v483)

## Principles

From first principles, **Principles** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (best_practices). This variant 483 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

From first principles, **Do** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (best_practices). This variant 483 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

From first principles, **Don't** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (best_practices). This variant 483 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineVectorSearchConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineVectorSearch(config: GraphragEngineVectorSearchConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
